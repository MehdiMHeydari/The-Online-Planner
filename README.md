# The-Online-Planner

Description: This is a web page I developed in 9th grade to be a planner where you could organize your assignments. I worked with other students on this project but I lead the development of the project and designed the idea
The Online Planner User Guide

Although The Online Planner may work on other browsers, to fully use its capabilities please use Google Chrome.

Please follow these steps to use The Online Planner correctly:

Download Google Chrome (click link)
Open the Online Planner file in Google Chrome
Please create your assignment by:
a) Selecting your class from the drop-down menu labeled “What Class?” in the “Add Assignment” form
b) Typing in the assignment into the text box under “Insert Assignment”
c) Selecting the due date of the assignment by clicking on a  date from the drop-down calendar under “Due Date” 
Note: If the calendar appears to be squished, press: ”command +” to zoom in, then “command -” to zoom back out. To zoom to the original size, press “command 0”. (if using windows, use “control” instead of “command”)
Click the “Create Assignment” button to create your assignment.
The assignment div will have the information from the create assignment form in the following order: assignment, class, due date (year, month, date).
See #7.
Drag the assignment div that appeared below to any spot you wish on the planner. Undragged assignments will still be saved in local storage, and they will appear on the left hand side of the calendar.
Your assignments are now stored onto the Local Storage. Local Storage means if you close or refresh the page, your planner information is still saved in that browser. The only rule for Local Storage is that the data will remain only on the specific browser you are using on that device.  This means that it won’t be visible on another device or browser.  
If you wish to mark the completion of an assignment click the little checkbox next to the period name and the block will change colors to represent completion.
There is a text box at the top of each planner column for notes on that day, BUT this area does not save in Local Storage, and neither does the checkbox save color (see #7).
If you wish to get rid of the data that you have inputted, click the “Clear All Data” Button and refresh the page.
Click the Head Royce Logo image to go to the Head-Royce webpage. 
The textbox to add other information is resizable, but if you refresh the page, it will reset to its default size.  However, the text that you may have inputted will not save either. (see #8).
If you make an assignment without inputting any data, it will automatically display “enter” in the created div as a default. 
You are now ready to go with your brand new Online Planner!
